# Handwritten Digit Recognition

![neural-network](banner.png)

## Project Description

This project is a handwritten digit recognition model using a neural network. The model was trained with the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing, each with a corresponding label (0 to 9) indicating the digit represented. The images are 28x28 grayscale pixel matrices, normalized to have values between 0 and 1.
